And now, let's move on to some famous Roman emperors. One of them, Augustus, was the first emperor and ruled for over 40 years. He's often called the \"founder of the Roman Empire.\" Imagine being Augustus and watching Rome grow and prosper under your rule!\n\nStudent: Wow, what an incredible responsibility! I wonder what challenges he faced as a leader.\n\nTeacher: Excellent question! Augustus dealt with many challenges, such as war\n"
